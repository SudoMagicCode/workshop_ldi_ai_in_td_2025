## A little about SudoMagic and  this workshop

The world of AI is moving at lightning speed – from new workflows to models to industry leaders – there’s a lot to keep up with when it comes to the world of generative AI. This workshop will cover a series of case studies of real-world uses of Gen AI in the immersive entertainment industry. Along with a deeper look at projects that have used AI, this session will cover an overview of the latest tools, how to design AI workflows, and approaches to prompt engineering. The goal of this workshop is to get up to speed with the latest in generative AI, to understand its strengths and weaknesses, and gain practical learnings from AI workflows.

SudoMagic is a boutique software and design studio that partners with organizations to bring their creative and technical ideas to life. The team at SudoMagic has produced everything from branded activations to immersive experiences, from permanent installations to bespoke pipeline tools and resources. Their clients include Meta, T-Mobile, UCLA, and Derivative among others.

In addition to commercial work, SudoMagic is an education and research focused studio. Most recently they collaborated with Derivative, makers of the TouchDesigner software, to help develop the official TouchDesigner Curriculum.

## Getting Ready

Before we begin, there are a few important things to keep in mind that will make the workshop run smoothly, and ensure you can focus on getting the most out of our time together. Below you’ll find a list of required first steps / tools to have with you, and some recommended steps to help you prepare.

### REQUIRED

Bring you Laptop – Mac or PC. Make sure you review the [System Requirements] from Derivative so you know you have a machine that’s TouchDesigner ready.
Don’t forget your power adapter – TouchDesigner is largely a GPU based environment. This makes for fast operations, but often means that your battery will get consumed quickly. You’ll definitely want your adapter, even if it’s a pain to lug around.

Download [TouchDesigner] – it’s very important to make sure your machine can run TouchDesigner before you get to the workshop. There are some specific graphics card requirements and making sure everything works before the first day will make sure we can get the group started right away. We'll be using the latest stable version of TouchDesigner for the workshop - if you have an older version installed, just know that some examples in the workshop may look a little different.

Get your TouchDesigner License – you can register for a Derivative account here - [Derivative Registration], and that will make sure you can create a non-commercial license key. The non-commercial license is free, and we won’t need anything more than this for our workshop.

### RECOMMENDED

**A 3 Button mouse** – You certainly can use a track pad while you’re working, but you’ll be much happier to have an actual mouse for working in Touch.
Download and Install a text Editor – [Visual Studio Code] is a great place to start if you don't have one.

**Bring some Assets** – You certainly don’t have to bring any extra assets, but it’s often nice to have more than just the stock images / videos handy.

**Be ready to share your contact info** – the best resources you’ll find at any workshop will be the other people in the room with you. If you’ve got some extra business cards make sure you bring a stack to share with the folks in our group.
