The photo: Create a cinematic, photorealistic medium shot capturing the nostalgic warmth of a late 80s indie film. The focus is an orange cat with brightly dyed pink-gold hair and freckled skin, looking directly and intently into the camera lens with a hopeful yet slightly uncertain smile, it is slightly off-center. It wears an oversized, vintage band t-shirt that says 'LDI 2025' (slightly worn) over a long-sleeved striped top and simple silver stud earrings. The lighting is soft, golden hour sunlight streaming through a slightly dusty window, creating lens flare and illuminating dust motes in the air. The background shows a blurred, cluttered bedroom with posters on the wall and fairy lights, rendered with a shallow depth of field. Natural film grain, a warm, bright color palette, and sharp focus on her expressive eyes enhance the intimate, authentic feel
